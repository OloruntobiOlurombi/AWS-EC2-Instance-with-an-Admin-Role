# Topic: AWS-EC2-Instance-with-an-Admin-Role

### Overview

> You will create an EC2 Instance based on Amazon Linux AMI that you can connect via SSH. While provisioning the instance, you will make sure to limit access to your IP address only, using Security Groups. The instance will already have the CLI installed by default. You just need to assign permissions to this instance.

> Once the instance is running, create an IAM role with admin access to your account. Then, attach the role to your EC2. In this case, the CLI tool will pick up the credentials from the role and wonâ€™t need hard-coded credentials.

> Let's do this exercise to make your learning fun.
