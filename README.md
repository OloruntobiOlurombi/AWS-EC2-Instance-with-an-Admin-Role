# Topic: AWS-EC2-Instance-with-an-Admin-Role

### Overview

> You will create an EC2 Instance based on Amazon Linux AMI that you can connect via SSH. While provisioning the instance, you will make sure to limit access to your IP address only, using Security Groups. The instance will already have the CLI installed by default. You just need to assign permissions to this instance.

> Once the instance is running, create an IAM role with admin access to your account. Then, attach the role to your EC2. In this case, the CLI tool will pick up the credentials from the role and wonâ€™t need hard-coded credentials.

> Let's do this exercise to make your learning fun.

### Prerequisites:
> AWS Account

### Tasks
> Launch a secure EC2 instance

> Create IAM role with admin privileges

> Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance created earlier

> Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH

> Use CLI tool in the EC2 instance

### Steps

#### Step 1:Create a default VPC

> It is possible that you already have a default VPC created in your account. If not, go to the VPC dashboard and create a default VPC.

> Use the Launch Instance wizard to launch an instance with the following configuration, and leave the remaining values as the defaults:

           Stage	                           Configuration	                    Value

                                          >  b. Network	                              Default
